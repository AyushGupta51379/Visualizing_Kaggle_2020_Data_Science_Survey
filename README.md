# Visualizing_Kaggle_2020_Data_Science_Survey
Data Visualization, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (D3.js library and Vue.js framework) - of Kaggle 2020 Data Science Survey. 
## About the data survey
- The survey was from users of a Data Science Challenges global platform called Kaggle. 
- It asked around 40 questions, from over 20 thousand users, covering 171 countries, related to their frequently used programming languages, machine learning frameworks, data visualization tools and more. 
- It also asked them general questions about their current role, annual compensation, country, gender and more. 
- You can access the full list of questions asked here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2020/data , after signing into Kaggle. 
- If you do not wish to sign in, you can access the questions list and methodology documents using this google drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZVLm3A_5LR0aq3Kmv7XHDUboethEfEi7?usp=sharing .

#### Explaination

##### Bar chart
The bar chart denotes annual compensation reported by the users of Kaggle. It represents the number of respondents getting annual compensation in a range, from the current x value to the next x value. Note that a significant number of users were students, and probably reported 0 for the compensation, thus the huge bar for 0. 

It can be filtered according to the country, either through drop down menu or by hovering over a circle in the circle graph. Initially, the bar chart represents all countries together.

##### Draggable circles graph
The circles graph represents the countries and number of respondents from each country (through the size and color encoding of the circles). You can hover over them which would show the bar chart of the corresponding country. The circles can also be dragged for fun.

##### Word Cloud graph
The word cloud represents the popularity of the tools used by the respondents of survey. You can select different tools such as IDE notebooks, Programming languages, Cloud computing platforms and more, to see their popularity. With the size and color encoding the popularity.

#### Heatmap
The heatmap represents the job titles, programming experience in years, and the corresponding number of respondents for them. The color encodes the number of respondents, darker color denotes more respondents, whereas lighter color denotes less respondents.
